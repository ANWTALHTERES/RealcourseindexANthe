 <h2> Because of my classmates not getting the meaning behind my last draft, I was gudied to look back at my first for insparation.
     The Idea was now to create something that visually could be read as sepration. I had taken insparation from the 
     famous painting  <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam" target="_blank"> <h3>  "Creation of Adam"</h3>   </a> 
    where the two figures try to touch hands.
