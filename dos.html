 <h2> I thought that having the posters be within the gif was a smart idea because it would be like switching a sing which would tie back to my idea of spotify being what I tracked.

    In the end of this assignment I realized that a Gif was less acssesable because you couldn't pause to read the informationa and that I should of made it into a video poster so that it could be more accsessable.I think that because of my struggles to 
    try and find a way to keep things cohesive I was not able to carry out my orginal plan that I felt would of worked a lot better.
