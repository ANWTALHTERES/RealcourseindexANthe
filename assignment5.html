    <h2> As the course went on we worked through numerous assignments. This assignment was worked on through each one where we would add our work from the semester.</h2>
 
  <h3> My experince with this assignment had been a lot of fun but also has had a lot of difficulties</h3>
  <p> I think that learning coding was the most fun from this semester and keeping track of the page was also extremley helpful because it meant that we didn't stop using code even when doing other things. The thing that I found mst difficult with coding was trying to get things to move how I wanted to, at times I got really upset with the code that I felt I could not do what I wanted and unfornetly did not achived what I hoped.
      In the end Course Index five was the final peice that I was able toput togther and I think it helps showcase what I did learn through class and extra readings and groupchats. I do belive that I have a lot more work to put into coding but I am most proud that I am able to keep links up and now in some way place images where I want them to.
