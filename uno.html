 <h2> My data collection started with me tracking on my phone about how loud the volume was, where was I in comaprisson, and what genre of music did I listen to. A lot of these were  key times of the day, at night when I got to work it would be quite but upbeat relating to me being in a good mood, or when I did work at school the music was louder and more calm in realtion to me being more foucsed.
     I had found a trend that related to my schdule and with the help of spotify tracking my last plaed songs and albums with a combnation of my Iphone settings telling my the time spent on the app I was able to recvie my Data form the project. 
</h2>

<h3> My next and most hardest step was trying to layout that data so it was readable, and could relate back to the app without being to matchy matchy. My first Idea was for a website but I had some trouble making it cohesive with making it a mess. 
    My second idea was to make a in person poster that would be moveable in diffrent sections to reveal more data. I found this a little hard as the paper would be ripping if pulled to many times and that not everything could be moveable.
    My final idea was to create a large digital poster with a 'screenshot' of every 'song'(day) layed out. This was a neater idea and was carried out but I didnt like that nothing was going on it felt flat.
    After creating a bunch of mini posters I thought to lay them out in a Gif and have them move as if they are being shuffled through just like how it would be on the app. In my opinion it realted back to the app without being to matchy but still gave a good idea on what i could be revewing for data, so this is when I carried out the plan.
